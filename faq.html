<h1>Frequently Answered Questions </h1>
<h2>Why did you create this website?</h2><p>We created this website because we wanted to help with the relief efforts during the second wave of the covid crisis in India. Three questions motivated us. First, like many, we found many requests for help on our social media feeds. But as Granovetter (https://doi.org/10.1086/225469) pointed out so many years ago, our social networks limit the kinds of information to which we have access. Could our social circles restrict our ability to make an impact? Second, while great crowdsourcing sites (https://www.ketto.org) support charitable donations to individuals and groups, including for covid relief, sorting through these requests is difficult. Should we give to individuals or to organizations that help larger groups? Again this is not easy, as work by Deborah Small (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005) shows.
Finally, from prior  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2013.01.008">work by Adam Grant</a>  on charitable giving, we know that understanding the donation's impact is vital for those who give. But much of this scholarship on charitable giving does not focus on how people could usefully donate during a crisis. The COVID crisis is unusual because it not only global but also lasted a long time.
​How should we decide on where to donate during a crisis? The appeals on social media and our reactions to these appeals are fraught with emotion. The emotions may persuade us to donate, and yet, we may feel unsatisfied with our donations.
Thus, we developed three criteria to help us with our pragmatic decision making:
a) To diversify the kinds of charities doing the work.
b) To establish a way for individuals to create a charitable portfolio mix.
c) To foreground the impact of the donation given the portfolio.</p><h2>How did we pick these charities? (inclusion criteria)</h2><p>Sensible criteria to pick charities should include the overhead (the lower, the better, https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/; https://www.charitynavigator.org), and exactly how the charity expends the money among its priorities. We should also see evidence of real-time impact.
These criteria complicated matters. During the pandemic in India, we find hyper-local civic organizations, often just a group of well-meaning individuals, providing relief. For many of these organizations, the overheads and the amounts spent on specific types of relief are unclear. Furthermore, in India, moved by personal loss, many would like to donate to a particular region or a particular kind of infrastructure (e.g., oxygen; food for children).
​We curated a diverse set of charities that show impact through frequently updated Instagram posts, blogs, and website updates. As we learn more about the financial overhead of these charities and how they spend the donations, we will include them in our impact assessment. If you use this website to inform your donation decisions, you should be mindful of the limitations of our methodology. </p><h2>How did we get the information about the charities?</h2><p> We obtained information about these charities from their websites or social media pages. These charities are not always clear on how they will use the money that they receive. So, suppose a charity says that it helps with medical infrastructure,  food, and transportation. In that case, we assume that the charity will divide your donation equally among the three causes. </p><h2>Can I re-purpose your code for my country?</h2><p>Certainly! While we developed our website for India, the website is de-coupled from the underlying data making it easy to use the code for another country. In addition, the code is open source. It is available at: () It should be straightforward to adapt it to suit your region. </p>
